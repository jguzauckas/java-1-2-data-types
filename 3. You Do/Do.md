# You Do

In the `Do.java` file, there are several lines of partially declared variables. Can you finish the declarations while meeting the requirements?

Line 3 - Can you assign the value that is the biggest number that can be assigned to this type?
Line 4 - Can you assign the value that is the smallest number that can be assigned to this type?
Line 5 - Set this variable to your favorite whole number. Can you make it so that this variable's value can never be changed?
Line 6 - Can you assign the value that has the maximum number of decimal places that this type can support?
Lines 7 and 8 - Can you assign the two options for this type between the two lines?

Your goal is the eliminate the errors (highlighted in red) and instead ensure there is only warnings (highlighted in yellow), as that means there are no data type issues, just issues with the variables not being used further.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
